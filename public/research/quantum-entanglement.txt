ABSTRACT:
This paper explores the latest developments in quantum entanglement within photonic systems. We demonstrate novel techniques for creating and maintaining entangled photon pairs at room temperature, which has significant implications for quantum computing and secure communications. Our experimental results show a 40% improvement in coherence time compared to previous methods.

Introduction:
Quantum entanglement represents one of the most fascinating phenomena in modern physics. When two particles become entangled, their quantum states remain correlated regardless of the distance between them. This paper focuses on photonic systems, where photons serve as the carriers of quantum information.

Methods:
We utilized a modified parametric down-conversion process in a nonlinear crystal lattice. The experimental setup included high-precision optical components and cryogenic temperature control systems to minimize decoherence effects.

Results:
Our experiments successfully generated entangled photon pairs with unprecedented stability. The average coherence time reached 2.8 microseconds, representing a 40% improvement over conventional methods. We observed strong violation of Bell's inequality, confirming the quantum nature of the correlations.

Discussion:
These results open new possibilities for practical quantum computing applications. The enhanced stability allows for more complex quantum algorithms to be implemented before decoherence destroys the quantum information.
