ABSTRACT:
We present a novel approach to neural network optimization inspired by biological neural plasticity. Our biomimetic algorithm mimics the synaptic pruning and strengthening processes observed in mammalian brains, resulting in more efficient and accurate neural networks. Testing on standard benchmarks shows a 25% reduction in training time while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Introduction:
Traditional neural network training methods rely on gradient descent and backpropagation. While effective, these approaches don't fully capture the dynamic nature of biological learning. This research introduces principles from neuroscience to enhance artificial neural networks.

Methodology:
Our algorithm implements three key biological principles:
1. Synaptic Pruning: Weak connections are systematically removed
2. Hebbian Learning: Connections that fire together are strengthened
3. Homeostatic Plasticity: Overall network activity is regulated

The implementation uses adaptive thresholds and dynamic learning rates that adjust based on connection strength and usage patterns.

Results:
Testing on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets demonstrated:
- 25% faster training convergence
- 12% reduction in network size without accuracy loss
- Better generalization on unseen data
- More robust performance with noisy inputs

The biomimetic approach proved particularly effective for complex, multi-layer architectures where traditional optimization struggles.

Discussion:
These results suggest that incorporating biological principles into machine learning can yield significant practical benefits. The efficiency gains are especially important for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Future Work:
We plan to explore additional biological mechanisms such as neurogenesis and glial cell interactions to further enhance network performance.
